// This has a few parts. There's the actual key, there's its hole and there's
// shaft that guides the key down to press the button

// The length of the shaft should be no longer than the distance from the inside
// top wall edge to the top of the box. This also implies that the shaft should
// be bigger than the button's shaft.
